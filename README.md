# ðŸ¥Š Bubble Brawl
Bubble Brawl is a game created by [Yoav TC](https://yoavtc.work/), [Eyal Label](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eyal-label/), [Yavin Mozes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaniv-mozes-2170b3238/), [Jonathan Quiben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-quiben/), [Ilan Gavirel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igavriel/), [Alon Kaplan](https://globalgamejam.org/users/alon-kaplan), and [Ohad Dori](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ohad-dori/). It was made for the [Global Game Jam 2025](https://globalgamejam.org/) event with the theme "Bubble" in just 48 hours.

We attended a real-life event between the 23rd - 25th of january, hosted by the amazing folks over at [Unity (IronSource)](https://www.is.com/) and [GameIs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gameis/) in the TLV Unity offices.

The game is a couch-multiplayer, 2-player fighting game in which you need to knock the opponent off the platform while wearing a bubble suit. The game turned out to be a big success, as during the showcase phase of the Game Jam event we received a tones of compliments and lots of players that wanted to keep on playing.
